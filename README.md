# RemoteWhitelist
This script allows you to control the visibility of a VRChat GameObject's children based on a remote whitelist.

The whitelist is stored in a text file, which can be hosted:
* Disbridge (*.disbridge.com)
* GitHub (*.github.io) https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart <-- Recommended
* Github Gist (gist.githubusercontent.com)
* Pastebin (pastebin.com)
* VRCDN (*.vrcdn.cloud)
